* mobs don't make sounds like groaning etc. (except footsteps) unless needing to communicate
* creepers seek chests and beds
* mobs keep walking forward if they knock player back with a hit (esp. zombies)
* creepers predictively prime detonation and keep walking
* creeper consider exploding just for funs to make terrain harder to navigate
** especially useful on the surface, if creepers would just choose to despawn (see below) otherwise
* creepers try to explode ores
* skellys can pick up dipped arrows and swords and use them when in melee
* ranged mobs kite
* dodge projectiles/juke
* mobs know direction & distance through player sounds (footsteps) and name tag
* predictively shoot projectiles
* trickshots for skellys (over obstacles)
* neutrals attack if player holds item they want or are mad about
** wolves: meat, fish(?), bone
** wolves attack player if they kill sheep in front of them (you stole their food!)
** goats: milk or wheat
** lamas: leather or wheat
** bees: honey-related and flower-related
** polar bear: fish, meat(?), ice, snow (player destroying environment)
** pandas: anything jungle-related (player destroying environment) and cake
** dolphin: fish and ocean-related (player destroying environment)
** iron golems: emerald(? doesn't make too much sense "story-wise" bc then iron golems are scaring off players from trading) and if player mines or takes anything from village. Anything iron-related
** piglin: anything gold, except armor
* mobs can decide to despawn
* projectile prediction code can be used to make mobs path towards where player runs (gives a bit "surrounding" effect)
* block player from sleeping by staying near (-> gives phantoms eventually)
* spiders carry other mobs
* neutral mobs alert other neutral and hostile mobs to attack in packs when they get attacked (like pigmen)
* mobs move out of way for skellys
* witches throwing heals/regens should enable mobs to walk around normally, even in daylight!
* witches heal undeads and team up with them
* witches throw regens & heals to normal mobs (they do this in raids for teammates too)
* witches continuously keep themselves & others buffed (legal self-buffs: speed, waterbreathing, flame res, legal splash-buffs: regen)
* blazes protect their drops by flying over lava or away from player
* blazes shoot at blaze rods
* mobs trap/stalk the player, especially on other side of nether /end gates
* don't enter boats or minecarts unless chasing player
* don't care about not stepping on rails
* mobs with powerful items picked up from player walk around together with creepers to get their items blown up when they die
* all mobs protect blaze rods and ender pearls (try to destroy them or hinder player)
** mobs detroy valuable items by picking them up and self-destructing in lava or throwing them into fire, creeper, cactus etc.
* mobs can hide & sneak up on player
* enable movements player can do: climb ladders etc
** if they have hands, they can open doors & press buttons. If not, they can open wood doors by "walking into them" (in one direction only) and only press buttons etc if they collide with their body.
* mobs jump over gaps
* silverfish can choose to exit blocks
* mobs protect spawners and end portal
** especially fun with silverfish: could enter end portal once it's open
* mobs communicate exact player position by sound
* bats use 'echolocation' to share cave layout & pathfinding with other mobs
** bats (and other mobs) form information chains. Once player is seen, all mobs that transitively hear each other know where they are.

* mobs form groups
* shulkers teleport preemptively
* shulker projectiles can go diagonally
* shulkers & endermen cluster at the end ship if player gets near
* endermen abuse picking up and placing blocks
* endermen abuse teleportation to warp in front of players to get eye contact
* endermen abuse teleportation to block bow shots
* endermen abuse teleportation to inform other mobs about player position
* endermen abuse teleportation to teleport onto player's square when player tries to flee by towering
* endermen build staircases for other mobs
* endermen maliciously place TNT (e.g. behind buttons at iron doors)
* endermen step on pressure plates in pyramids etc
* mobs time their attacks to circumvent shields
* mobs time-kill wandering traders to get their invis potions
* shulkers teleport in way of player to block paths (may also open to knock players off)
* piglins attack players if player carries gold
* zombie pigmen stand between mobs and player, and cluster/follow in front of player to get in way
* ghasts hide in lava
* ghasts & creepers target player structures
* mobs won't let you hit feet by standing there dumbly (esp. wither skels)
** mobs, esp. iron golems, will move away from player if they can't reach them, so as to not get hit
* mobs target player before iron golems/villagers (except zombies for villageres) and //natural// iron golems know when this is the case and will not go out of their way to attack to attack mobs
* neutrals cooperate with hostiles if mad
* neutral mobs keep attacking continuously (applies to lamas, pandas & bees I think)
* piglin and hoglin will keep being hostile even after they turn in overworld
** pigman-turned-piglin will even return to nether to call for pigmen reinforcement
* pigmen herds chase through portals
* neutral mobs (esp pigmen) don't forgive even if player dies
* mobs target tamed creatures if player isn't priority (esp. zombies/spiders counterattack when hit by wolf)
* mobs with (cross-)bows preload them
** so do skeletons (i.e. they "hold their shot" to shoot immediately)
* mobs can climb ladders & vines
* the ocean is a problem. Very hard to stop player.
** maybe guardians spawn and swim from massive distances?
** dolphins could buff drowneds (and maybe others), thus making them able to chase boats
*** dolphins swim alongside boat to keep around player and wait for hostile mobs to buff
*** if then dolphins refuse to buff players, works out nicely
** drowneds can attack boats
** fish and squids could swim in way
